# Can I Keep My Wife?
You have married a woman from a foreign country and your first Valentine's Day is spent being interrogated by the Department of Homeland Security to determine if the marriage is fraudulent.

This is a trivia game where 3 couples compete. Each person will have their own white board or pad of paper to write on and then show the group when answers are being reveled.

There are no official point values for questions. The host (interviewer) will decide what answers seem reasonable and assign whatever points they like. As a standard you could do 10 points per question. Also, getting an answer correct doesn't mean points are assigned. Points are given by the Interviewer if they think the answer helps prove they are married. Feel free to take away points if things feel suspicious.
